To answer the aforementioned goals (see Chapter~\ref{Aim}, p.~\pageref{Aim}), three main experimental approaches were taken:

\bigskip

\begin{enumerate}

\item Fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) was used in order to separate, concentrate, and purify different intracellular virus populations representing distinct maturation intermediates of the parvovirus life cycle. 
\item Standard biochemical and molecular biological methods were performed to investigate the structural and functional characteristics of the isolated virus populations.   
\item Site-directed mutagenesis on an infectious clone of MVM was applied to challenge obtained results and reinforce concluding observations.



\end{enumerate}
