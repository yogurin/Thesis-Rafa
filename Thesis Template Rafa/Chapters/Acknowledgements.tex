The present thesis would not have been possible without the support and guidance that I received from many individuals. All of them contributed in one way or another and extended their valuable assistance during the preparation and completion of this study. It is a great pleasure to express my gratitude to all of them in my humble acknowledgement.

Foremost I want to thank Prof. Dr. Christoph Kempf for providing me with the opportunity to complete my PhD in his research group. Thank you very much for your active support and the freedom you gave me during the time in your lab.  

\par\medskip 
\noindent
I feel deeply indebted and honored to be mentored by Dr. Carlos Ros, my direct supervisor, who believed in my abilities and patiently guided me through the whole thesis. I am always grateful for his encouragement and for inspiring me with numerous clever experiments which helped to substantiate my scientific outlook. The joy and enthusiasm he has for our research was exemplary, contagious, and motivated me greatly during my PhD. I received constructive and competent feedback with regards to critical reading of papers as well as coherent presentation and skeptical interpretation of my results. His helpfulness and great sense of humor helped me to overcome experimental setbacks and provided a nice working atmosphere.    
    
\par\medskip 
\noindent
I would like to thank all the former and current co-workers in our laboratory: Aurélie Allemann, Chiarina Di Tommaso, Remo Leisi, Nico Ruprecht, Marcus von Nordheim, and Seline Zürcher. Our group has been a source of friendships as well as good collaboration. It was very pleasant to work in such a friendly and helpful environment. 

\par\medskip

I gratefully acknowledge the funding received towards my PhD from the university of Bern as well as CSL Behring AG.

\par\medskip 
\noindent
Further thanks go to Achim Stocker and Walter Aeschimann for their advice and kind help with the Äkta chromatography system and for optimizing the chromatography protocols. It has been always interesting to gain further insight into the field of virology from totally different perspectives.      

\par\medskip 
\noindent
My time at the university of Bern was made enjoyable in large part due to the many friends at the department of chemistry and biochemistry (DCB). I am grateful for the time I spent with you, for partying together and for the time we spent in the city, on the Gurten or down by the Aare. Special thanks go to Christof Wyss and his family for annually offering us a royal residence in their lovely chalet in Grindelwald during our memorable skiing vacations! 

\par\medskip 
\noindent
I want to thank Dr. Shweta Kailasan and Dr. Pamela Nicholson for critical review of parts of the present PhD thesis and for their helpful annotations in revising my English language. 
   

\par\medskip 
\noindent
Many thanks go to my best friends Martin Buob and Christian Schnyder for frequently distracting me form work and always giving me a warm welcome back at home in Neuenkirch. They always kept me well informed about the most recent happenings in Lucerne, thus I never felt fully disconnected. I really enjoyed the countless amazing moments I could share together with you whether it be just having a beer in a bar, enjoying the atmosphere at an open-air concert, or traveling around and discovering new places. In addition, I really appreciate the many barbecues I had together with you and our friends at Sagiweg 3 in Neuenkirch!            


\par\medskip

I would like to thank Stefan Hofstetter for pitching \LaTeX~to me and for rescuing me from the flaws of Microsoft word. I appreciate his invaluable advice and his patient help with the organization of the template file. It helped me definitely to save a lot of time, energy and pain! 

\par\medskip 
\noindent
I want to thank Markus Antener, my long-standing flat mate, for the funny time we had together and for bearing me for eight years! Thanks a lot for all the computer support and for providing me always with the latest software. I thank Marion Landolt for always arranging our flat with many flowers, paintings, pictures, and photos, thus making it a pleasant and comfortable place to live. I loved a lot her "bündnerische" nature and her crazy ideas. Thank you both for regularly taking me out and for all the relaxing activities we undertook together.

\par\medskip 
\noindent
Last but definitely not least I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my lovely family. A special thanks to my parents Beat and Pia for all of the sacrifices that you have made on my behalf. Your faith in me was what sustained me thus far. Thanks for your thoughtfulness, encouragement, and financial support. You were all the time on hand with help and advice for me. I further thank Chantal, Nadine, and Anja for being the best sisters and for their warmth and words of advice. Thank you.

Un agradecimiento profundo al profesor José María Almendral del Río por su colaboración y por hacer posible mi breve estancia en el Centro de Biología Molecular Severo Ochoa (CBMSO) en la Universidad Autónoma de Madrid (UAM). Muchas gracias por hacer los días tan agradables en tu laboratorio y por periódicamente sacarnos a pasear para comer en el centro. Quedo en deuda contigo por haber puesto a mi disposición gran cantidad de material, anticuerpos y mutantes incluso, después de mi partida.

\par\medskip 
\noindent
Especial mención merecen Nooshin Bayat y Lorena Gallego Villar por todas las chulas actividades que hacíamos juntos en Madrid. Ha sido un verdadero placer conoceros y descubrir parte de Madrid con vosotros. Fue muy divertido e interesante conocer Madrid, la comida rica, la cultura y las fiestas españolas! Muchas gracias por todos los buenos momentos que compartimos.

Quiero agradecer a mis queridos compañeros que trabajan en Madrid. A Carlos Dominguez Redondo, Jon Gil Ranedo, Josefa González Nicolás, Marta Pérez Illana y Aroa Tato de la Torre por haberme acogido tan amablemente en el grupo y por el ambiente de trabajo muy divertido y socorrido.
