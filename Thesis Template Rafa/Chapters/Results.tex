\section{The Phosphoserine-Rich N-VP2 of MVM Facilitates Nuclear Targeting and Assisits in Cytolysis}
\label{Cytoskeleton}


\renewcommand{\thefigure}{S\arabic{figure}}
\setcounter{figure}{0}

In order to investigate a possible involvement of the distal serine phosphorylations within N-VP2 in MVM egress, we generated a mutant, referred to as 5SG, having all the distal serine residues substituted by glycine. In Figure~\ref{S1}, p.~\pageref{S1} several aspects of the infection with 5SG, such as nuclear targeting, nuclear export, and cytotoxicity are shown.

We analyzed the capacity of 5SG to enter the cells and target the nucleus. To this end, the accumulation of viral DNA in the nucleus at increasing times pi was quantitatively determined by qPCR. 5SG was approximately 5$\times$ less efficient in replicating viral DNA in the nucleus, indicating that fewer virions reached the nucleus, thus delivering less DNA templates to initiate viral replication. Indeed, the amount of viral DNA in the nuclei of 5SG infected cells was similar to the quantities that were obtained when the cells were infected with 5$\times$ less WT virions (see Figure~\ref{S1} A, p.~\pageref{S1}).

Nuclear export of 5SG progeny was not significantly affected. Virions were efficiently exported from the nucleus even though showing a slight delay in cytoplasmic accumulation (see Figure~\ref{S1} B, p.~\pageref{S1}). This delay is caused by defects in early steps of infection prior to the initiation of DNA replication, such as binding, endosomal escape, viral uptake, or nuclear targeting. Genetic removal of the distal phosphorylations of N-VP2 might hamper an efficient \textit{in vivo} cleavage of VP2 to generate VP3, thus affecting endosomal processing and escape. Hence, fewer incoming virions reach the nuclei where they initiate the replication of the viral DNA. However, since only a lower amount of viral DNA serves as a template for replication, the amplification of the viral genome is delayed. Collectively, the delayed nuclear DNA accumulation and progeny morphogenesis directly affect the kinetics of egress, explaining the slight lag in progeny accumulation in the cytoplasm seen in Figure~\ref{S1} B, p.~\pageref{S1}.          
 
As early as 20 hpi, the WT virus caused a pronounced reorganization of the cytoskeleton resulting in cell rounding. At later times (40 hpi), increasing amounts of cells appeared rounded and detached, eventually resulting in cell death (see Figure~\ref{S1} C, 1\textsuperscript{st} row, p.~\pageref{S1}). In contrast, 5SG virions were significantly less cytotoxic. Even as late as 40 hpi most of the infected cells still exhibited the typical fibroblastic phenotype and only a few cells became rounded. No signs of apoptosis and cytolysis were observed (see Figure~\ref{S1} C, 2\textsuperscript{nd} row, p.~\pageref{S1}).

Productive MVM infection produces a strong cytopathic effect in the host cell, ultimately causing cellular lysis. Such dramatic changes in the cytoskeleton filaments involve gelsolin-mediated degradation of actin fibers resulting in the generation of characteristic ``actin-patches'' \cite{pmid18704167}. While the actin filaments become destabilized, the microtubule network is maintained during the course of infection \cite{pmid15582663}. The latter observation together with the previously reported capsid-dynamin co-localization~\cite{pmid18704167} would be in agreement with a microtubule dependent egress of MVM. The modest delay in nuclear targeting and the fewer amount of progeny DNA accumulated in the nucleus by the 5SG mutant (see Figure~\ref{S1} A, p.~\pageref{S1}) cannot explain the considerable delay of the cytopathic effect of more than 20 h. N-VP2 is removed by proteolytic digestion during endosomal uptake. Hence, it is not involved in important signaling for viral DNA replication. Additionally, it has been demonstrated that there are no significant differences in the cytoplasmic accumulation of WT and 5SG progeny virions (see Figure~\ref{S1} B, p.~\pageref{S1}). Therefore, the phosphorylations on N-VP2, which represent the only difference between the WT and 5SG progeny, are likely involved in late events mediating the rearrangement of the cytoskeleton during egress. 5SG seems to be defective for severing the actin filaments resulting in prolonged maintenance of the cytoskeleton and cell integrity. 


Similar observations have been reported by Tullis \textit{et al.}~\cite{pmid1448928} by using a MVM mutant harboring a deletion in N-VP2 without altering the phosphorylated residues. The 7 amino acid deletion mutant lacking the trypsin-sensitive residues 17-23 within N-VP2 was slightly defective for binding and approximately 10$\times$ deficient, compared to the WT, in initiating a productive infection. However, \textit{in vivo} processing of N-VP2 was still achieved. Because this mutation affects both structural proteins VP1 and VP2, it is difficult to distinguish their relative contribution to the mutant phenotype. However, the binding defect is more likely a VP2 effect since virions lacking VP1 are not defective in binding to susceptible cells \cite{pmid8416366}. In addition to its defect in cell binding, the mutant produced approximately 10$\times$ less viral DNA in the nuclei of infected cells, suggesting that fewer mutant virions, on the average, reached the nucleus where they can initiate DNA replication. Nonetheless, those that managed to reach the nucleus, replicated normally. Similar to 5SG, this mutant was delayed in egress from the cells late in asynchronous infections. However, mutant progeny virions efficiently egress early in the infection, as well as in highly synchronized infections. Therefore, this effect might be a nonspecific defect in some aspect of cytolysis rather than a defect in an active egress mechanism \cite{pmid1448928}. A less efficient cytolysis would hamper the passive release and spread of intracellular progeny virions, thus preventing their contribution in a next round of infection.

\medskip
\textbf{Summary:} Collectively, these results strongly suggest an involvement of the phosphoserine-rich N-VP2 late in infection. N-VP2 appears to be involved in cytoskeleton reorganization and cytolysis facilitating passive release of progeny virions but it does not actively participate in the transport mechanism underlying active egress. During entry, its proteolytic removal is required. Mutations affecting the tightly controlled processing of N-VP2 during virus entry have important implications in the efficiency of endosomal escape and nuclear targeting.

\section{NS2-Crm1 Interaction is Required for Nuclear Export but Not for the Late Nuclear Maturation}

Interestingly, a substantial retention of progeny virions in the nucleus of infected cells was observed for NS2 mutants defective for the interaction with Crm1 (see Section~\ref{Export}, p.~\pageref{Export}) \cite{pmid12239307, pmid11884550}. Since FC-P\textsubscript{1} virions are nuclear export deficient, it is tempting to speculate that NS2 might assist the nuclear maturation of FC-P\textsubscript{1} to generate FC-P\textsubscript{2}. This maturation includes the externalization of N-VP2 and phosphorylation of readily accessible residues on the capsid surface (see Manuscript, pp.~\pageref{ChapterPub1}~-~\pageref{ChapterPub1End}). A putative direct or indirect involvement of NS2 in the final nuclear maturation of MVM progeny virions would be cell type specific because the nuclear export of the progeny in human transformed cells has been demonstrated to be NS2 and/or Crm1 independent \cite{pmid2147041, pmid15367635}. Moreover, it has been previously shown that human transformed cells are capable of phosphorylating the viral capsids more efficiently compared to restrictive mouse fibroblasts \cite{pmid11069983}. In line with this concept, late nuclear maturation of NS2-Crm\textsuperscript{-} mutants might be less impaired in transformed cells due to their elevated basal kinase activity. To test this hypothesis we produced NS2-Crm1\textsuperscript{-} mutants using transfection in NB324K cells. The generated progeny was used to infect A9 mouse fibroblasts in order to analyze the late nuclear maturation steps for the NS2-Crm1\textsuperscript{-} mutant.       

As shown in Figure~\ref{S1B} A p.~\pageref{S1B}, NB324K cells were able to produce fully mature FC-P\textsubscript{2} MVM NES-22 \cite{pmid12239307} progeny virions. Similar quantities were obtained as for transfections with the WT infectious clone pIC-MVMp (see Section~\ref{IC}, p.~\pageref{IC}). The NS2-Crm1 interaction is not required for the late nuclear maturation in the nuclei of mouse fibroblasts as demonstrated in Figure~\ref{S1B} B, p.~\pageref{S1B}. Both DNA containing particles, FC-P\textsubscript{1} and FC-P\textsubscript{2}, appeared in the nucleus of murine cells infected with the NES-22 mutant. However, at 26 hpi the mutant showed a dissimilar AEX profile to that of the WT. Instead of the typically balanced ratio between FC-P\textsubscript{1} and FC-P\textsubscript{2} observed for the WT, NES-22 FC-P\textsubscript{2} was the predominant population 26 hpi. This data reinforces previous reports suggesting a nuclear retention of NES-22 progeny virions \cite{pmid12239307, pmid11884550}.     

             

\textbf{Summary:} Collectively, these results indicate that the late nuclear progeny maturation does not require the interaction of NS2 with Crm1. However, we confirm previous data suggesting a nuclear retention of progeny virions for the NES-22 mutant in murine fibroblasts. Our result shows that the NES of NS2 is involved in the export of the fully mature FC-P\textsubscript{2} virion progeny and not in late nuclear maturation events. Currently, it is unknown whether NS2 directly interacts with the capsid to export it from the nucleus. Extensive attempts to demonstrate such an interaction failed. Hence, the multi-functional NS2 protein might indirectly assist the nuclear export of the virion progeny by orchestrating cellular pathways which do not affect progeny maturation in the nucleus of mouse fibroblasts. The requirement of NS2 for progeny egress is cell type specific since NS2 null mutants grow to wild-type levels in human NB324K cells. Moreover, the requirement of the Crm1 pathway in nuclear export of progeny virions is restricted to murine fibroblasts since MVM progeny virions egress from human transformed cells even following LMB treatment.

\section{The Role of Empty Capsids During the Infection}

Empty capsids (EC) represent more than half of the virus progeny. They are not infectious but might interfere with a productive infection. Therefore, it is of interest to characterize their role during the course of infection. DNA packaging and the late capsid surface phosphorylations are a prerequisite for the externalization of N-VP2. EC lack both a viral genome and the late phosphorylations, thus having their N-VP2 termini buried in the interior of the capsid. Hence, EC represent a useful tool to study the role of N-VP2 during early steps in infection, such as binding and endosomal uptake.   

\subsection{Isolation and Characterization of Empty Capsids}

In addition to the previously characterized FC populations (FC-P\textsubscript{1} and FC-P\textsubscript{2}), infected cells produce a considerable amount of EC. Due to the lack of DNA, EC band at lower density compared to FC following differential centrifugation in CsCl. While FC entered the gradient to a density of 1.46 gcm\textsuperscript{-3}, EC banded at 1.32 gcm\textsuperscript{-3}, as determined by refractometry (see Figure~\ref{S2} A, p.~\pageref{S2}). A quantitative PCR analysis of the corresponding fractions confirmed that viral DNA containing particles were depleted from EC to almost a thousand times (see Figure~\ref{S2} B, p.~\pageref{S2}). First of all, we verified their N-VP2 conformation. In Figure~\ref{S2} C and D, p.~\pageref{S2} it is shown that N-VP2 of EC is not accessible to specific antibodies and proteolytic digestion by $\alpha$-chymotrypsin (CHT), respectively. 

\subsection{Empty Capsids Specifically Bind to Sialic Acid}

Figure~\ref{S2b} A and B, p.~\pageref{S2b} demonstrates that both EC and FC restrictively bind to sialic acid (SA) moieties on the surface of murine A9 cells. Binding of both capsid species can be efficiently prevented by pre-treatment of A9 cells using neuraminidase (Neur, see Table~\ref{Enzymes}, p.~\pageref{Enzymes}) at doses higher than 50 U/mL. Neuraminidase specifically hydrolyzes glycosidic linkages of neuraminic acids. These results confirm that both capsid species bind to the same class of receptor molecules on the surface of susceptible murine cells. Therefore, EC could have the potential to compete with FC for SA moieties on the cell surface and disturb early steps of the infection.

\subsection{Preferential Binding of Full Capsids to Murine Fibroblasts}

In order to characterize the binding specificity of FC and EC, both capsid types were allowed to bind discretely to susceptible, restrictive murine fibroblasts. It was important to minimize uptake of virus into cells to exclusively study virus-receptor interactions. Viral entry can be prevented at reduced temperatures. At \mbox{4~\textcelsius}, active cell-mediated uptake through endocytosis is prohibited, thus bound viral particles remain attached to their receptor molecules on the cell surface but do not internalize \cite{pmid20517}. The differences for N-VP2 accessibility can be used to distinguish EC and FC in IF experiments. Staining of FC results in co-localization of $\alpha$-capsid and $\alpha$-N-VP2 antibodies whereas EC are detected by $\alpha$-capsid antibodies only (see Figure~\ref{S3} A, upper rows, p.~\pageref{S3}). When FC and EC were bound to cells at equal stoichiometry, FC had a higher binding affinity for SA. Even under non-saturated conditions, EC were detected rarely when applied as mixed populations (see Figure~\ref{S3} A, 3\textsuperscript{rd} row, p.~\pageref{S3}). Only when an equal amount of EC was added prior to the FC a slight increase in bound EC was observed (see Figure~\ref{S3} A, lowest row, p.~\pageref{S3}). Quantification of co-localization by scatter plot analysis in representative IF pictures revealed that binding of FC was not disturbed in the presence of EC (see Figure~\ref{S3} B, p.~\pageref{S3}).

Following removal of unbound viruses the cells were fixed and stained for IF using an antibody (mAb B7) raised against assembled capsids (green) and an antibody recognizing N-VP2 (red).

(B) Scatter plots analysis showing the indicated areas of interest were used to calculate the corresponding correlation coefficient as a measurement for the degree of co-localization.}

\subsection{Full Capsids have Better Binding Capacity to Sialic Acids than Empty Capsids}

A critical criteria for studying the attachment of a virus to its surface receptor represents the binding specificity of such an interaction. In general, specific attachment is limited to the number of available receptor molecules, thus it saturates as the amount of input virus increases. For A9 cells it has been reported that they offer 5 $\times$ 10\textsuperscript{5} specific binding sites per cell \cite{pmid20517}. In Figure~\ref{S4} A, p.~\pageref{S4} it is shown that saturation could be achieved at PFUs higher than 20, corresponding to approximately 10\textsuperscript{4} viruses per cell. In addition, specific binding can be competed by adding an excess of particles competing for the same receptor. Linser \textit{et al.} demonstrated that preliminary bound radio-labeled capsids were displaced by subsequently adding an excess of unlabeled particles. However, large quantities of unlabeled particles were required in order to demonstrate competition. Only by exceeding the amount of initially bound virus particles by 20-40$\times$, competition was observed under saturating conditions. Due to the large amount of viral particles required, they were not able to demonstrate complete competition \cite{pmid20517}. Even though working under similar conditions, we were not able to demonstrate competition between FC and EC, FC and proteolytically cleaved FC (FC\textsuperscript{CHT}), and FC\textsuperscript{CHT} and EC (see Figure~\ref{S4} B, C, and D, respectively, p.~\pageref{S4}). This indicates that still higher PFUs would have been required to demonstrate competition. However, it might be more difficult to compete for binding with EC or FC\textsuperscript{CHT} since N-VP2 might stabilize the primary attachment to the cell surface. The most clear evidence for this assumption is given by the fact that EC only modestly bind to the cell surface when applied together with FC, as observed in IF experiments (see Figure~\ref{S3} A, lower rows, p.~\pageref{S3}). EC might not only compete for primary receptor attachment but also for intracellular interactions required for uncoating and trafficking. Therefore, we studied the potential of EC to interfere with the progression of a natural infection. As shown in Figure~\ref{S4}, p.~\pageref{S4}, even a large excess of EC does not interfere with the infection process. 

Collectively, we conclude that EC do not interfere with a productive infection, even though representing a large population in a normal infection. In order to disturb binding to cells, an overwhelming excess of EC which is not found in nature would be required. N-VP2 might be involved in the stabilization of primary attachment of MVM to susceptible cells as judged by IF analyses (see Figure~\ref{S3} A, 3\textsuperscript{rd} row, p.~\pageref{S3}). However, besides N-VP2 exposure, the packaged ssDNA genome and the surface phosphorylations represent further known differences between EC and FC which might directly or indirectly influence receptor binding. In summary, N-VP2 might have minor importance during early steps in infection except for its own proteolytic digestion which is important to allow N-VP1 externalization. However, N-VP2 appears to mediate the rearrangement of the cytoskeleton late in infection (see Section~\ref{Cytoskeleton}, p.~\pageref{Cytoskeleton}), thus being a key player in cytolysis and viral release.

\label{S4}
\end{figure}

\medskip
\textbf{Summary:} Both FC and EC specifically bind to SA moieties coupled to an unknown receptor(s) on susceptible cells. Hence, they are both sensitive to neuraminidase. The overwhelming amount of receptor molecules on the cell surface complicates working under saturated conditions. Under non-saturated conditions EC bound significantly less efficient than FC and they were not able to compete with FC even when added at an excess of up to 40$\times$. However, although N-VP2 represents the major structural difference between FC and EC, it is not directly involved in stabilizing the binding of MVM since its proteolytic removal did not decrease the binding efficiency.   



\section[AEX as a Novel Tool to Study the Surface Conformation of Small Non-Enveloped Viruses]{Anion-Exchange Chromatography as a Novel Tool to Study the Surface of Small Non-Enveloped Viruses}


As previously mentioned, parvoviruses undergo many interactions with their respective host cell due to their strong host cell dependence. Such interactions may preferentially occur on the very surface of incoming or progeny particles because it is readily accessible to the host's enzymes. Therefore, their net surface electrostatics can change as a consequence of host cell induced modifications on the capsid surface. As demonstrated in the present thesis, intranuclear virion populations representing different maturation stages of MVM were successfully separated by AEX based on different surface charges, in this case as a result of distinct surface phosphorylations. Fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC, see Section~\ref{ÄKTA}, p.~\pageref{ÄKTA}) is a high performance chromatography method that combines several advantages. First, the small-diameter stationary phase enables high resolution and fast flow rates. Secondly, samples can be diluted in bio-compatible aqueous buffer systems and large sample volumes can be injected to the system. Thirdly, separation is highly reproducible due to a high level of automation including gradient program control and fraction collection. Finally, a full range of chromatography modes, such as ion exchange, chromatofocusing, gel filtration, hydrophobic interaction, and reverse phase can be provided \cite{pmid20978981}. 

We tried to apply AEX on other parvoviruses than MVM, such as B19V and CPV. B19V is a widespread human pathogen which can cause severe disease in human beings. It belongs to the genus \textit{Erythroparvovirus} (see Section~\ref{B19V}, p.~\pageref{B19V}) and thus, it is highly erythrotropic. B19V efficiently replicates in rapidly dividing erythroid progenitor cells, such as erythroblasts and megakaryocytes present in the bone marrow \cite{pmid12097253}. Only fully mature virions migrate to the blood plasma of infected individuals where they can persist at high titers (see Figure~\ref{S5} A, p.~\pageref{S5}). CPV emerged in the mid-1970s as a new pathogen of dogs. Equally to MVM, it belongs to the genus \textit{Protoparvovirus} (see Section~\ref{CPV}, p.~\pageref{CPV}) and replicates in tissues containing rapidly proliferating cells, including the bone marrow, lymph nodes, and the spleen \cite{pmid20152105}. Stocks of CPV were generated in canine A72 cell culture. The cells were productively infected and virus progeny was isolated by lysis of infected cell cultures. By doing so, pre-mature and mature virus progeny were not physically separated (see Figure~\ref{S5} B, p.~\pageref{S5}). 

The AEX profiles of B19V derived from plasma samples and CPV derived from cell culture were analyzed. As expected, there was one sharp peak in the case of B19V. Since only the fully mature virions can migrate from the bone marrow to the blood plasma, they eluted as a single homogeneous population from the AEX column (see Figure~\ref{S5} C, p.~\pageref{S5}). Similar to MVM, two populations were detectable in the case of CPV (see Figure~\ref{S5} F, p.~\pageref{S5}). Binding interaction is known to rearrange the VP1u conformation of B19V. Upon receptor attachment, B19V exposes its VP1u on the surface of the capsid \cite{pmid20826697}. Since such a rearrangement of the capsid surface influences the surface electrostatics, the profile of bound B19V was found to be distinct from the one of the stock virus (see Figure~\ref{S5} D, p.~\pageref{S5}). The situation became even more complex when intracellular virus was analyzed. B19V undergoes complex phosphorylation and partially uncoats during entry (Ruprecht, N. \textit{et al.}, manuscript in preparation). The formerly homogeneous stock virus displayed a highly complex AEX profile consisting of several peaks (see Figure~\ref{S5} E, p.~\pageref{S5}). In order to analyze such a complex profile, cell fractionation prior to AEX analysis should be required. Another possibility would be to infect the cells in the presence of chemical compounds which interfere with certain maturation steps preventing such a complex AEX profile. 

\medskip
\textbf{Summary:} AEX represents a powerful tool to physically separate intracellular virus populations and to gain insights into progeny virus maturation. Coupled to cell fractionation and/or pharmacological interference it can provide valuable information on the role of a particular cellular pathway in the infection. Isolated virus sub-populations can be further characterized by standard biochemical and molecular biological methods.

   {\textbf{AEX can be applied to study other parvoviruses. (A)} B19V is produced in the bone marrow of infected individuals. Only mature particles accumulate in the blood plasma where they productively infect erythroid progenitor cells. \textbf{(B)} CPV was produced in tissue cell culture. Pre-mature and mature particles were not efficiently separated. \textbf{(C)} AEX profile of B19V derived from blood plasm. \textbf{(D)} AEX profile of B19V following binding to UT-7/EPO-S1 cells at \mbox{4 \textcelsius}~for 1h. \textbf{(E)} AEX profile of B19V internalized in UT-7/EPO-S1 cells for 3 h at \mbox{37 \textcelsius}.  \textbf{(F)} AEX profile of CPV produced in canine A72 cells. Virus was recovered from infected cells by repeated freeze and thaw cycles to lyse the cells.}
