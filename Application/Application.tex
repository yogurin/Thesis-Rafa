\textbf{\large{Job application for the advertised scientist position}} \\[0.2 cm]


Dear Dr. C. John,

\bigskip
I was very interested to read your post regarding the open scientist position in your company advertised in careerjet on 25. August 2015. Your company attracted me for its quality, innovative philosophy, and social responsibility which correspond to my career expectations. 

\medskip
I first came into touch with virology during my master degree at the University of Bern which was aimed to optimize the propagation system of parvovirus B19, a widespread human pathogen. I decided to accomplish my PhD degree in the same laboratory of Prof. Dr. Christoph Kempf. During my postgraduate studies I dissected the late nuclear maturation steps of parvovirus minute virus of mice (MVM) preceding active egress of the virion progeny. By applying anion-exchange chromatography, mature and pre-mature virus populations were physically separated and an active egress was confirmed for the mature population in the absence of cellular lysis. This observation challenges the basic principle in virology considering release of non-enveloped viruses as a mere consequence of a lytic burst at the end of the infection.  

\medskip
My work involved a great deal of independent research, requiring initiative, organization, self-motivation and a wide range of skills. In the laboratory I was confronted with many biochemical and molecular biological methods, including qPCR, viral mutagenesis, cell culture, protein expression and purification, immunofluorescence, and immunological assays. During my studies I was exposed to an international team requiring strong interpersonal skills. My project involved critical reading of papers, as well as, coherent presentation and rigorous interpretation of my results.

\medskip
I believe that my experience in virology and strong determination correspond very well to this position. I am able to take on the responsibility of this position from mid-November and have the enthusiasm to quickly become familiar with new methods and requirements related to the work at your company.

\bigskip
Thank you for taking the time to consider this application and I look forward to hearing from you in the near future.

\bigskip
\medskip
Yours sincerely, \\ [0.5 cm]
